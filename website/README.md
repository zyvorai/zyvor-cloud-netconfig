# cloud-netconfig docs site

Built with [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/). Serves the live docs at https://zyvorai.github.io/zyvor-cloud-netconfig/.

Points directly at the repo's existing `docs/` folder (`docusaurus.config.ts`'s `docs.path: '../docs'`) rather than a hand-curated copy — every doc becomes a page automatically, sidebar auto-generated from the folder structure.

## Local development

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

## Build

```bash
npm run build
npm run serve   # preview the production build locally
```

## Deployment

Deployment is automatic: `.github/workflows/pages.yml` builds and publishes this site to GitHub Pages on every push to `main` that touches `website/`, `docs/`, or the workflow file itself.
